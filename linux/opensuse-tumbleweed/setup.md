# OpenSUSE Tumbleweed

## Intial setup
After the system has been installed, the [setup script](/linux/opensuse-tumbleweed/initial-setup.sh) can be ran to handle
some basic tasks such as installing frequently used applications (chrome, vlc, gear-lever) and utilities
(google fonts, codecs). Run the script using the following command:

```sh
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stager-Software/workstation-setup/refs/heads/main/linux/opensuse-tumbleweed/initial-setup.sh)
```
