# Workstation setup

At Stager, we mostly run on Linux machines. We currently use two flavors of Linux - OpenSUSE Tumbleweed (which was our main for a long time, but is no longer being installed on new machines due to a new preference) and Mint (which is what we put on new machines due to it being more stable and generally more user friendly for Linux newbies)

- To see more about installing a new Linux Mint machine, refer to [/linux/mint/setup.md](/linux/mint/setup.md)
